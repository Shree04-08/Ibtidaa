An internship based on data analytics on world happiness index by Ibtidaa

World Happiness Index – Data Analytics

This project was developed as part of the Ibtidaa Internship (AICTE Initiative). The goal of this internship project was to perform data analytics on the World Happiness Index dataset to understand the factors that influence happiness across different countries.

# Objectives:
To analyze the World Happiness Report dataset.
To identify key factors (social, economic, and health indicators) that affect happiness scores.
To visualize trends and patterns across different countries and years.
To gain insights through data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis.

# Dataset:
The dataset used is based on the World Happiness Index, which includes factors like:
Happiness Score
GDP per Capita
Social Support
Healthy Life Expectancy
Freedom to Make Life Choices
Generosity
Perceptions of Corruption

# Features of the Project:
## Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.
Created visualizations to compare happiness scores across regions.
Identified correlations between different features and overall happiness.
Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard for visual exploration of the dataset.

# Tools & Technologies:
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Streamlit – Interactive web dashboard
Jupyter Notebook – Code execution and analysis
