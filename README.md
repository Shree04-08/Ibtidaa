World Happiness Index – Data Analytics

This project was developed as part of the Ibtidaa Internship (AICTE Initiative). The goal of this internship project was to perform data analytics on the World Happiness Index dataset to understand the factors that influence happiness across different countries.

# Objectives:
 To analyze the World Happiness Report dataset. 

 To identify key factors (social, economic, and health indicators) that affect happiness scores. 
 
 To visualize trends and patterns across different countries and years. 

 To gain insights through data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis. 

# Dataset:
 The dataset used is based on the World Happiness Index, which includes factors like:

 Happiness Score 

 GDP per Capita 

 Social Support 

 Healthy Life Expectancy 

 Freedom to Make Life Choices 

 Generosity 

 Perceptions of Corruption 

# Features of the Project:
 Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.

 Created visualizations to compare happiness scores across regions. 

 Identified correlations between different features and overall happiness.

 Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard for visual exploration of the dataset. 

# Tools & Technologies:
 Python 

 Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing 

 Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization 

 Streamlit – Interactive web dashboard 

 Jupyter Notebook – Code execution and analysis
